    "cat_yoga_desc": "I completed the Yoga Teacher Training, later expanding my training in Yoga for different life stages and moments, and deepening in the Yoga tradition as a path of self-knowledge.",
    "approach": "Yoga, present since the beginning, ended up becoming the central axis of my professional life, along with Massages and Therapies. During this process my love for Sanskrit and mantras was also born, a tool that continues to accompany my classes and sessions as a bridge between body, breath, and consciousness.",

    "arunachala_p1": "Over time, a clear dream arose: to create an own space to unite Yoga and Manual Therapies, a place where each person could feel accompanied with respect, listening, and presence.\n\nThat dream took shape after a very special trip to India, where I lived a deeply transformative experience: the ascent to the Holy Mountain Aruṇāchala, in Tiruvannamalai. There I understood that the center that was gestating already had a name, Aruṇāchala.\n\nA space that offers Yoga, Massages, and Therapies as a path of integral well-being, adaptation, and conscious care.",
